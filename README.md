# Tron
Created by Sidharth Lakshmanan

Goal:
      The goal of this project was to create a clone of the real life tron game. However, differing from the clone,
      this project only consists of the 2-player mode. There is also the sound of bikes running in the background
      as the project is running. When a boost is pressed, the bike sound changes to reflect the new change.
      
Controls:
      For Player 1, the controls are ESDF with the boost being Q
      For Player 2, the controls are the arrow keys with the boost being P
